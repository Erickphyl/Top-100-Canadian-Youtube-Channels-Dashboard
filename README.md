# ðŸ“Š Top 100 Canadian Youtube Channels Dashboard

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
- What is the key pain point?
  
The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2025 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Identify the top 100 Canadian YouTubers
- Create a dashboard with key metrics (total subscribers, videos, views, engagement ratios, and channel category)
- Recommend channels for campaign types (sponsorships, influencer marketing, product placements)
- Support data-driven decisions to maximize ROI

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.
